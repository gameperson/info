            <p>Some say it was a prayer, no one knows for sure.</p> 
            <p>It started with a tremor rippling through the butterfly collective. Not like a tremor of fear, but something with the feeling of focused intent. Monarchs, Painted Ladies, Swallowtails – millions gathered. Their wings, vibrant tapestries, began a synchronized beat.</p> 
            <p>They said it was soft at first, a whisper. Then, with the spread across the lands, it became a rustle, a hum, a growing roar.</p>
            <p>The butterfly tremor spread. Word, carried on the pollen-dusted legs of bees, the rapid wings of hummingbirds, and the calls of swallows, rippled through the natural world. A wrong felt deep in the earth needed righting.</p>
            <p>Bees, their buzzing a low thrum of agreement, joined in forming the gathering motion. Their intricate knowledge of wind currents and collective power added precision to the butterfly's swirling energy. Hummingbirds, jewels of the air, darted through the forming vortex, their tiny wings amplifying the spin, creating focused gusts within the larger flow.</p>
            <p>They all danced the sacred call to the four winds, a vibration that turned them around and started the rotation.</p>
            <p>Then came the birds. Crows, their calls sharp directives, guided the burgeoning whirlwind. Swallows, masters of aerial dance, wove intricate patterns, strengthening its form. Even the stoic owls, perched on distant branches, lent their ancient wisdom to the effort.</p>
            <p>The winds </p>
            <p>The whirlwind, gathering gathered over the warm ocean intensified. It wasn't just butterflies now, but a symphony of wings, buzzing, and calls, all directed at the gaudy edifice by the sea. </p>
            <p>The billionaires inside, oblivious in their gilded cages, felt only a strange pressure, a shift in the air, before their world began to lift and dissolve into the storm.</p>
            <p>Over Southern Florida the air shimmered. A gentle breeze became a current. Palm trees swayed harder, then bent. Windows rattled. The collective beat intensified. The humming grew into a low, resonant thrum. A vortex swirled, tightening.</p> 
            <p>The tornado, born of iridescent wings, descended. It wasn't violent, but a precise, focused force. Mar-A-Lago lifted, a toy house caught in an unseen hand, and vanished into the churning sky.</p> 
            <p>The butterflies dispersed, their mission complete, leaving behind only the scent of sea air and the lingering form of a question mark in the sand below.</p>
